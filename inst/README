The evdbayes package implements Bayesian analyses of extreme
value models.

The users guide (in pdf) will be in the directory evdbayes/doc/  
underneath wherever the package is installed.
A reference manual containing the help files (in pdf) can be 
downloaded from CRAN.

The evdbayes/ directory contains a CHANGES file that 
documents the changes from previous versions.

All comments, criticisms and queries on the package or 
associated documentation are gratefully received.
